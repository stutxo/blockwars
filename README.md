**Tiny Rust web game**

_Work in progress, no real gameplay yet, just messing around._

use https://github.com/stutxo/wasm_to_image to shrink the wasm file as small as possible by turning it in to png. 

upload the png to nostr via https://supertestnet.github.io/nostr-image-host/ and fetch it in index.html
